# What  is Number System?

A number system is a way of representing numbers using a set of symbols. The most commonly used number system is the decimal system, which uses the symbols 0 to 9 to represent numbers. In a decimal system, the value of a digit is determined by its position within the number. For example, in the number "123", the digit "1" represents 100, the digit "2" represents 20, and the digit "3" represents 3.

Other number systems include binary, octal, and hexadecimal, which use 2, 8, and 16 symbols respectively to represent numbers. These systems are commonly used in computer science and engineering because they are more convenient for computers to work with than the decimal system.
